# Java Concepts Exercises Repository

Welcome to my Java Concepts Repository! This repository serves as a collection of exercises I have done to have a better and deeper understanding of Java as a programming language.

## Table of Contents

- [OOP](./src/OOP/)
- [Exception Handling](./src/ExceptionHandling/)
- [File Input/Output](./src/FileInputOutput/)

## Expected Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on different Java concepts and topics. Each folder contains exercises, sample code, and notes. And some of these are:

- **Exception Handling**: Understanding try-catch blocks, custom exceptions, etc.
- **File I/O**: Reading and writing files, handling streams, etc.
- **OOP Principles**: Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
- **Collections Framework**: Lists, maps, sets, and their operations.

## Instructions on how to run the program
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RominaCaballero/Java-Concepts-Exercises.git

2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA:
